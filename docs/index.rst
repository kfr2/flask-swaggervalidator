Flask-SwaggerValidator
======================

Flask-SwaggerValidator is a utility to validate Flask requests and responses
against an `OpenAPI Specification <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification>`_ (Swagger) document. It presently does so through decorators that are applied to an application's view functions.

It is currently very early in development so its interfaces may drastically change.
